The BZDev class library includes code for creating a
file with a MIME type of video/vnd.bzdev.image-sequence+zip
and the Debian package will configure the windows system
to recognize this type of file and use a specific icon for
it.  The installer, however, is meant for a variety of
systems.

The cvrdecode directory (either /usr/local/share/cvrdecode, /usr/opt/cvrdecod, or
for Windows, %PROGRAMDATA%\cvrdecode) will contain a file named
share.zip. On systems that support the freedesktop.org standards one
should look at the environment variables XDG_DATA_HOME and
XDG_DATA_DIRS. These typically define directory search paths, and will
typically have a directory /usr/share in one of these paths. With
/usr/share as an example, running

    sudo unzip share.zip -d /usr/share/
    sudo update-mime-database

will create the necessary files.  In other cases, one will have to
follow whatever procedure that particular window system and operating
system uses.

To configure a window-system that does not follow the freedesktop.org
standard, one should start by extracting various files from
share.zip. Some of these files can be read as text files and provide
specifications for how the window system should be configure.  Other
files provide icons.  The file share.zip contains the following
directory:

    * icons/


The icons directory contains a directory named hicolor, which
contains directories named and NxN, where N is a postivie integer.
Each of these directories contains a subdirectory named apps, which contains the icons used in lists of application..  The files for cvrdecode are the
following:

    icons/hicolor/NxN/apps/cvrdecode.png

where N = 16, 20, 22, 24, 32, 36, 48, 64, 72, 96, 128, 192, and
256. The "scalable" directories represent icons with SVG (Scalable
Vector Graphics) files so that icons of any desired size can be
created.  The NxN directories contain PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
files with the images having fixed sizes (N is the number of pixels
for the width and height).
