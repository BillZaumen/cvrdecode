  <H2>An overview of CVRDecode</H2>
  <P>
    CVRDecode (or cvrdecode) is a small utility that reads
    multiple California digital vaccine records, provided
    as image files, shc URIs, or files, ending in the
    file-name extension ".shc" that contain shc URIs. These
    records are then printed using a CSV (Comma Separated
    Values) format, with only selected portions of the records
    shown. This list is sorted by name and birthday. CSV data
    can be readily imported by spreadsheets.
  <P>
    CVRDecode can be run in three ways:
    <UL>
      <LI> As a desktop application. The procedure for
	starting a desktop application is window-system
	dependent.
      <LI> As a program started from the command line by
	running the command
	<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
cvrdecode	     
	</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <LI> as flatpak program started from the command line
	by running the command
	<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
flatpak run org.bzdev.CVRDecode	     
	</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
    </UL>
eog    With no arguments, a GUI will start. Otherwise, the
    remaining command-line arguments should be options
    followed by file names or URIs.
  <P>
    The command-line options are
    <UL>
      <LI><STRONG>--</STRONG>: end  of options.
      <LI><STRONG>-i</STRONG>: there can be at most one remaining
	argument. If there is no additional argument or the additional
	argument is <STRONG>-</STRONG>, a series of
	<STRONG>shc</STRONG> URIs, one per line, is read from the
	standard input.  If there is an additional argument other than
	<STRONG>-</STRONG>, it must be the file name for a file
	containing <STRONG>shc</STRONG> URIs, one per line.  The
	output will be in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format, with a
	header followed by a description of each record, one record
	per line.  The records will be sorted by family name, given
	names, and date of birth.
      <LI><STRONG>-u</STRONG>: the remaining arguments must be file
	names or URIs that start with <STRONG>shc:/</STRONG> The URIs
	will be extracted from the inputs by either decoding a QR
	code, reading a URI contained in a file as text, or accepting
	the URI passed literally as an argument. Each URI will be
	printed, one per line, on standard output.
      <LI><STRONG>-v</STRONG>: the remaining argument, if present,
	must be either a file name for an image file, the
	character <STRONG>-</STRONG> (denoting standard input), or a
	URI that start with <STRONG>shc:/</STRONG>.  If there are no
	remaining arguments, standard input is used.  The URI will be
	either extracted from a QR code, copied from the content of
	the input or obtained from the literal value of an argument.
	The URI will then be decoded, and its contents pretty-printed.
	A final line indicates if the signature was valid or not.
      <LI><STRONG>-z</STRONG>: there may be at most one additional
	argument: a file name, which may be either the name of a file or
	<STRONG>-</STRONG>, which denotes standard input.  If there
	are no additional arguments, standard input is read.  The
	input must be a ZIP file.  The files contained in the ZIP file
	will be processed to generate a sorted CSV file as described
	above.
      <LI><STRONG>-h</STRONG>, <STRONG>-?</STRONG>,
	or <STRONG>--help</STRONG>: a copy of the manual page will be
	displayed.
    </UL>
  <P>
    When started as a desktop application, CVSDecode displays a window
    with several buttons:
  <DIV>
    <CENTER><IMG WIDTH="800pt" HEIGHT="auto" SCR="screenshot2.png"></CENTER>
  </DIV>
  <P>
    The first two buttons determine the input and output. The first
    button sets the input directory and the second sets the output
    file for the CSV data. Once the input and output are set, the
    Run button becomes active, and clicking it will generate the CSV
    file. Two additional buttons let one view the table immediately
    and check for any error messages.
