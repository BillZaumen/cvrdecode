The program cvrdecode will store data from a collection
of California digital vaccine records in a file or print
it to standard output.


---------------

  Debian packages needed for running and compiling:

    openjdk-11-jdk
    openjdk-11-jdk-headless
    openjdk-11-jre
    openjdk-11-jre-headless
    inkscape-1.0.2-3ubuntu1

   (inkscape is used to generate icons of various sizes)

  Creating CSV output, parsing JSON, and displaying a table:

    libbzdev-java

    The libraries needed on the classpath are
        /usr/share/java/libbzdev-base.jar
        /usr/share/java/libbzdev-desktop.jar

  QR-Code processing:
    libzxing-core-java  (depends on libzxing-java)
    libzxing-java       (depends on libjcommander-java)
    libzxing-javase-java (depends on libzxing-java)

    libjcommander-java is a dependency, but is not used explicitly
    by cvrdecode (and almost certainly not by small number of
    xzing classes cvrdecode uses).

    The QR-Code libraries needed on the class path are
    /usr/share/java/core.jar and /usr/share/java/javase.jar
    (which are poorly named for that location - the names should
    start with some string such as "zxing-" as this directory is
    a standard location for Java libraries).
