  <H1>An overview of CVRDecode</H1>
  <P>
    CVRDecode (or cvrdecode) is a small utility that reads multiple
    California digital vaccine records, provided as image files, shc
    URIs, or files, ending in the file-name extension ".shc" that
    contain shc URIs. These records are then printed using a CSV
    (Comma Separated Values) format, with only selected portions of
    the records shown. This list is sorted by name and date of
    birth. CSV data can be readily imported by spreadsheets. Please
    see <A HREF="installing.html">the installer web page</A> for
    installation instructions.
  <P>
    CVRDecode can be run in four ways:
    <UL>
      <LI> <A HREF="#desktop">as a desktop application</A>. The
	procedure for starting a desktop application is window-system
	dependent.  This is automatically supported when CVRDecode is
	installed by a package manager (e.g., apt, synaptic, etc.) or
	by <CODE>flatpak</CODE>. It may be supported when CVRDecode is
	installed by running the installer, provided some additional
	configuration is performed manually.
      <LI> <A HREF="#cli">as a program</A> started from the command line by
	running the command
	<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>

  cvrdecode
	</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
	possibly with command-line arguments This is supported when
	CVRDecode is installed by a package manager (e.g., apt, synaptic, etc.)
	or by running the installer application.
      <LI> <A HREF="#cli">as a flatpak program</A> started from the command line
	by running the command
	<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>

  flatpak run org.bzdev.CVRDecode
	</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
	possibly with command-line arguments. This is  supported when
	flatpak was used to install CVRDecode.
      <LI> <A HREF="#docker">as a web server</A> running in a Docker container.
    </UL>
    When run from a terminal with no arguments, a GUI will
    start. Otherwise, the remaining command-line arguments should be
    options followed by file names or URIs.
    <p>
    When run from the command line, the CSV data will be written to
    standard output (with the exception of the <STRONG>-u</STRONG> and
    <STRONG>-v</STRONG> options described below). When run as a
    desktop application, the CSV data will be written to a file.

    <h2><A NAME="cli">1.0 Command-line Options</A></h2>
  <P>
    The command-line options are
    <UL>
      <LI><STRONG>--</STRONG>: end  of options.
      <LI><STRONG>-i</STRONG>: there can be at most one remaining
	argument. If there is no additional argument or the additional
	argument is <STRONG>-</STRONG>, a series of
	<STRONG>shc</STRONG> URIs, one per line, is read from the
	standard input.  If there is an additional argument other than
	<STRONG>-</STRONG>, it must be the file name for a file
	containing <STRONG>shc</STRONG> URIs, one per line.  The
	output will be in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format, with a
	header followed by a description of each record, one record
	per line.  The records will be sorted by family name, given
	names, and date of birth.
      <LI><STRONG>-u</STRONG>: the remaining arguments must be file
	names or URIs that start with <STRONG>shc:/</STRONG> The URIs
	will be extracted from the inputs by either decoding a QR
	code, reading a URI contained in a file as text, or accepting
	the URI passed literally as an argument. Each URI will be
	printed, one per line, on standard output.
      <LI><STRONG>-v</STRONG>: the remaining argument, if present,
	must be either a file name for an image file, the
	character <STRONG>-</STRONG> (denoting standard input), or a
	URI that start with <STRONG>shc:/</STRONG>.  If there are no
	remaining arguments, standard input is used.  The URI will be
	either extracted from a QR code, copied from the content of
	the input or obtained from the literal value of an argument.
	The URI will then be decoded, and its contents pretty-printed.
	A final line indicates if the signature was valid or not. The
	output will be written to standard output.
      <LI><STRONG>-z</STRONG>: there may be at most one additional
	argument: a file name, which may be either the name of a file or
	<STRONG>-</STRONG>, which denotes standard input.  If there
	are no additional arguments, standard input is read.  The
	input must be a ZIP file.  The files contained in the ZIP file
	will be processed to generate a sorted CSV file as described
	above.
      <LI><STRONG>-h</STRONG>, <STRONG>-?</STRONG>,
	or <STRONG>--help</STRONG>: a copy of the manual page will be
	displayed. This option is provided for flatpak alone: what is
	displayed is the manual page.
    </UL>
  <P>
    If there are no command-line arguments, a GUI will start.
    If there no options, the command-line arguments should be
    image files or text files containing SHC URIs with file names
    ending in the suffix ".shc".

    <H2><A NAME="desktop">2.0 Use as a desktop application</A></H2>
  <P>
    Linux distributions typically  come with window managers that
    can display the installed desktop applications, so that a user
    can click on an icon to start a program.  The following is one
    example - the upper right icon in the following illustration
    will start CVRDecode.
    <CENTER>
      <IMG WIDTH="741" HEIGHT="366" SRC="appview.png">
    </CENTER>
  <P>
    When started as a desktop application, CVRDecode displays a window
    with several buttons:
    <CENTER><A HREF="screenshot.png" TARGET="_blank">
	<IMG WIDTH="800pt" HEIGHT="450" SRC="screenshot2.png">
      </A>
    </CENTER>
  <P>
    The first two buttons determine the input and output. The first
    button sets the input directory (or ZIP file) and the second sets
    the output file for CSV data. Once the corresponding file or
    directory is set, the button changes its background color to a
    pale yellow.  Once the input and output are set, the
    <STRONG>Run</STRONG> button becomes active, and clicking it
    will generate the CSV file. Two additional buttons let one view
    the table immediately and check for any error messages. The final
    button, named <STRONG>Exit</STRONG>, terminates the program. The
    table is mostly self explanatory, with two exceptions:
    <UL>
      <LI>the column indicating if an individual is fully vaccinated
	is a boolean value and when <CODE>true</CODE>, the boolean
	value is followed by a number in parentheses.  That number
	indicates the number of vaccine doses received and is present
	when booster vaccinations were given.
      <LI> the last column, which provides an indication of the file
	containing the vaccine record, may be prefaced with a number
	in square brackets that is basically a footnote.  When these
	exist, a short table at the end gives the host name for
	whatever organization provided the public key used to verify
	a record.  The user should check this domain name to verify that
	it belongs to a trusted organization.
    </UL>

    <H2>3.0 Privacy</H2>
  <P>
    If the records, whether as images or as files containing
    <STRONG>shc</STRONG> URIs, are stored in a GPG-encrypted file,
    the command
    <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>

  gpg -d ENCRYPTED_FILE | cvrdecode -z > table.csv
    </PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
    will generate a CSV file as described above but without the full records
    being stored in a file system. GPG will simply ask for a passphrase to
    decrypt the file.

    <H2><A NAME="docker">4.0 Docker</A></H2>
  <P>
    CVRDecode is available as a Docker image.  The Docker image
    provides a web server that will except a ZIP file containing
    California digital vaccine records as an input and that will
    produce a table as its output. To start it, use the command
    <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>

  docker run --publish 80:80 --detach --name cvrdecode wtzbzdev/cvrdecode:1.0
    </PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
    The server is configured using 5 environment variables, three of
    which can by set with the <STRONG>--env</STRONG> option provided
    by <STRONG>docker run</STRONG>:
    <UL>
      <LI><STRONG>BACKLOG=</STRONG><U>M</U> where M is a positive
	integer providing the TCP backlog.  The default is 30.
      <LI><STRONG>NTHREADS=</STRONG><U>M</U> where M is a positive
	integer indicating the number of threads the server may use.
	The default is 50.
      <LI><STRONG>TRACE=</STRONG><U>TRUE</U> turns on tracing (which is
	off by default).
      <LI><STRONG>IPADDR=</STRONG><U>ADDR</U> sets the server's IP
	address. Well-known values are <STRONG>wildcard</STRONG> and
	<STRONG>loopback</STRONG>. The default is <STRONG>wildcard</STRONG>
	and should not be changed unless a new Dockerfile is created.
      <LI><STRONG>PORT=</STRONG><U>PORT</U>. This sets the server's
	TCP port to <U>PORT</U>. The default is 80 and should not be changed
	unless the Dockerfile is modified.
    </UL>
    <P>
      The variables <STRONG>BACKLOG</STRONG>, <STRONG>NTHREAD</STRONG>,
      and <STRONG>TRACE</STRONG> can be set using the
      <STRONG>docker run</STRONG>
      option <STRONG>--env</STRONG>. Changing the others using
      the <STRONG>--env</STRONG> option may prevent the web server
      from being visible outside of its container.

    <P>
      To stop the server, run the commands
    <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>

  docker stop cvrdecode
  docker rm cvrdecode
    </PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H3>4.1 Using the server</H3>

    The server expects a URL with no path: for example
    <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>

  http://localhost/
    </PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>
      When this URL is visited by a browser, a simple web page will be
      shown. This page contains an HTML form with two controls.  One
      control allows the user to specify a ZIP file containing images
      of California digital vaccine records and/or text files with the
      suffix ".shc", each containing a Smart Health Card URI.  . When
      the button labeled <STRONG>Download Table</STRONG> is pushed,
      the server will upload the ZIP file and return a CSV file that
      the user can save or open with a suitable application such as
      a spreadsheet.

      <H3>4.2 Deploying the server</H3>
    <P>
      The commands provided above are sufficient for using the docker
      image locally or on a private network.  For public use, one should
      treat the server as an application server and configure a publicly
      visible web server as a reverse proxy using HTTPS. For large scale
      use, one may want to use Docker Swarm or Kubenetes in order to add
      CVRDecode servers as needed. The CVRDecode server is stateless.

    <H2>5.0 Use Cases</H2>
    <P>
      CVRDecode was written based on a use case generated from
      personal experience. During the summer of 2021, people were
      hosting private events, typically outdoors, with a requirement
      that everyone attending was vaccinated. You could provide a
      vaccination record upon arrival, but you could also email a
      photo of a vaccination record in advance.  a volunteer would
      then check a list (a paper copy as who was helping with what was
      often not known in advance). Manually copying records for 50 or
      so people is time consuming. CVRDecode was written to help
      automate the process.
    <P>
      For an event run by a business or organization, it is easy to
      provide an appropriate device for scanning the QR codes. When
      the person checking the records is chosen at the last moment,
      however, that person might not want to load additional software
      onto his or her smart phone or drain the phone's battery. In
      this case, a "low tech" solution is a good choice.
    <P>
      CVRDecode can also be used with the <STRONG>-v</STRONG> option
      so that user's can determine if their California digital vaccine
      record is correct - it will display all the information encoded
      by the QRCode (although the actual reason for this option was as
      an aid for software development).
