  <H1>An overview of CVRDecode</H1>
  <P>
    CVRDecode (or cvrdecode) is a small utility that reads multiple
    California digital vaccine records, provided as image files, shc
    URIs, or files, ending in the file-name extension ".shc" that
    contain shc URIs. These records are then printed using a CSV
    (Comma Separated Values) format, with only selected portions of
    the records shown. This list is sorted by name and date of
    birth. CSV data can be readily imported by spreadsheets.
  <P>
    CVRDecode can be run in three ways:
    <UL>
      <LI> <A HREF="#desktop"> As a desktop application</A>. The
	procedure for starting a desktop application is window-system
	dependent.
      <LI> As a program started from the command line by
	running the command
	<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>

  cvrdecode
	</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
	possibly with command-line arguments.
      <LI> as a flatpak program started from the command line
	by running the command
	<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>

  flatpak run org.bzdev.CVRDecode
	</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
	possibly with command-line arguments.
    </UL>
    When run from a terminal with no arguments, a GUI will
    start. Otherwise, the remaining command-line arguments should be
    options followed by file names or URIs.
    <p>
    When run from the command line, the CSV data will be written to
    standard output (with the exception of the <STRONG>-u</STRONG> and
    <STRONG>-v</STRONG> options described below). When run as a
    desktop application, the CSV data will be written to a file.

    <h2>Command-line Options</h2>
  <P>
    The command-line options are
    <UL>
      <LI><STRONG>--</STRONG>: end  of options.
      <LI><STRONG>-i</STRONG>: there can be at most one remaining
	argument. If there is no additional argument or the additional
	argument is <STRONG>-</STRONG>, a series of
	<STRONG>shc</STRONG> URIs, one per line, is read from the
	standard input.  If there is an additional argument other than
	<STRONG>-</STRONG>, it must be the file name for a file
	containing <STRONG>shc</STRONG> URIs, one per line.  The
	output will be in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format, with a
	header followed by a description of each record, one record
	per line.  The records will be sorted by family name, given
	names, and date of birth.
      <LI><STRONG>-u</STRONG>: the remaining arguments must be file
	names or URIs that start with <STRONG>shc:/</STRONG> The URIs
	will be extracted from the inputs by either decoding a QR
	code, reading a URI contained in a file as text, or accepting
	the URI passed literally as an argument. Each URI will be
	printed, one per line, on standard output.
      <LI><STRONG>-v</STRONG>: the remaining argument, if present,
	must be either a file name for an image file, the
	character <STRONG>-</STRONG> (denoting standard input), or a
	URI that start with <STRONG>shc:/</STRONG>.  If there are no
	remaining arguments, standard input is used.  The URI will be
	either extracted from a QR code, copied from the content of
	the input or obtained from the literal value of an argument.
	The URI will then be decoded, and its contents pretty-printed.
	A final line indicates if the signature was valid or not. The
	output will be written to standard output.
      <LI><STRONG>-z</STRONG>: there may be at most one additional
	argument: a file name, which may be either the name of a file or
	<STRONG>-</STRONG>, which denotes standard input.  If there
	are no additional arguments, standard input is read.  The
	input must be a ZIP file.  The files contained in the ZIP file
	will be processed to generate a sorted CSV file as described
	above.
      <LI><STRONG>-h</STRONG>, <STRONG>-?</STRONG>,
	or <STRONG>--help</STRONG>: a copy of the manual page will be
	displayed. This option is provided for flatpak alone: what is
	displayed is the manual page.
    </UL>

    <H2><A NAME="desktop">Use as a desktop application</A></H2>
  <P>
    Linux distributions typically  come with window managers that
    can display the installed desktop applications, so that a user
    can click on an icon to start a program.  The following is one
    example - the upper right icon in the following illustration
    will start CVRDecode.
    <CENTER>
      <IMG WIDTH="741" HEIGHT="366" SRC="appview.png">
    </CENTER>
  <P>
    When started as a desktop application, CVRDecode displays a window
    with several buttons:
    <CENTER><A HREF="screenshot.png" TARGET="_blank">
	<IMG WIDTH="800pt" HEIGHT="450" SRC="screenshot2.png">
      </A>
    </CENTER>
  <P>
    The first two buttons determine the input and output. The first
    button sets the input directory (or ZIP file) and the second sets
    the output file for CSV data. Once the corresponding file or
    directory is set, the button changes its background color to a
    pale yellow.  Once the input and output are set, the
    <STRONG>Run</STRONG> button becomes active, and clicking it
    will generate the CSV file. Two additional buttons let one view
    the table immediately and check for any error messages. The final
    button, named <STRONG>Exit</STRONG>, terminates the program.

    <H2>Privacy</H2>
  <P>
    If the records, whether as images or as files containing
    <STRONG>shc</STRONG> URIs, are stored in a GPG-encrypted file,
    the command
    <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>

  gpg -d ENCRYPTED_FILE | cvrdecode -z > table.csv
    </PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
    will generate a CSV file as described above but without the full records
    being stored in a file system. GPG will simply ask for a passphrase to
    decrypt the file.

    <H2>Use Case</H2>
  <P>
    CVRDecode was written based on a use case generated from personal
    experience. During the summer of 2021, people were hosting private
    events, typically outdoors, with a requirement that everyone attending
    was vaccinated. You could provide a vaccination record upon arrival,
    but you could also email a photo of a vaccination record in advance.
    a volunteer would then check a list (a paper copy as who was doing what
    was often not known in advance). Manually copying records for 50 or
    so people is time consuming. CVRDecode was written to help automate
    the process.
  <P>
    For an event run by a business or organization, it is easy to
    provide an appropriate device for scanning the QR codes. When the
    person checking the records is chosen at the last moment, however,
    that person might not want to load additional software onto his or
    her smart phone or drain the phone's battery. In this case, a
    "low tech" solution is a good choice.
