# CVRDecode

CVRDecode is a simple utility that can print selected fields from
a California digital vaccine record. Multiple records can be
processed simultaneously and can be displayed in a table
generated using a CSV (Comma Separated Values) format, which is
easy to import into applications such as spreadsheets.
